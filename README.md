## Today's Code Challenge!!

You’ve been hired by Facebook to rebuild their User class, congrats! Create a file named `user.rb` and build out the User class. Think about the attributes and actions that an instance of the User class will need (age, name, birthday) and actions they should be able to take (ability to post on a wall, poke, etc).

Hints:
+ Attribute accessors are your friends - you can use them in place of reader and writer methods (like name and name=).
+ Think about how Facebook users interact and the type of attributes and actions you will need. For instance the user might have a number of pokes that increases after they are poked by another user.
+ Don’t forget about instance variables!
+ Here's the completed gnome lab we did on Sunday [without attribute accessors](https://github.com/dfenjves/gnomecode/blob/master/gnome_no_accessors.rb) and [with attribute accessors for reference](https://github.com/dfenjves/gnomecode/blob/master/gnome.rb).
